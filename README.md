# DEV_Epicture_2020
Epitech Lyon - Imgur API implementation


## GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

As part of this project, you will take on the role of a Software Architect.

Your main goal is neither reinventing the wheel nor writing numerous lines of code. On the contrary, your
main action is to understand, select and integrate a wide range of existing libraries.

The code you write will only implement the so-called business logic. In other words, your main job will be
to write glue between selected software components to complete the requested project.

Before embarking on the carrying out of such a project, we suggest you take the time to analyze and understand the operation of each software brick. In the idea, we will talk about state of the art and POC:

- State of the art: Study the different possible solutions and choose the right component according to
what is needed.

- POC (Proof Of Concept): Make a quick demo program that proves the proper functioning of a component or algorithm.
